<h3>NAME</h3>
oak-security-audit: audit accounts, passwords, privileges and other
security settings.
<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
Perform a strict audit:
<blockquote>oak-security-audit</blockquote>
Perform a strict audit (explicit):
<blockquote>oak-security-audit --audit-level=strict</blockquote>
Perform a strict audit (explicit), handle the users 'my_admin' and
'my_assistant' as if they were 'root':
<blockquote>oak-security-audit --audit-level=strict
--assume-root=my_admin,my_assistant</blockquote>
Perform a normal level (more relaxed) audit:
<blockquote>oak-security-audit --audit-level=normal</blockquote>
Same as above, provide connection parameters, prompt for password:
<blockquote>oak-security-audit --user=root --ask-pass
--socket=/tmp/mysql.sock -l normal</blockquote>
Same as above, use defaults file:
<blockquote>oak-security-audit
--defaults-file=/home/myuser/.my-oak.cnf -l normal</blockquote>
<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
oak-security-audit connects to a MySQL instance and performs
comprehensive security tests. Tests are performed on the following
subjects:
<ul>
	<li>Accounts</li>
	<li>Passwords</li>
	<li>Privileges</li>
	<li>General</li>
</ul>
The utility prints a detailed report which lists the tests, the result
of each test, and recommendations. Recommendations may vary from
specific queries to be executed, to general guidelines for
consideration. The utility does not modify data or performs any of its
recommendations. It is up to the user to decide if and how to act. The
following audits are performed:
<ul>
	<li>Accounts
	<ul>
		<li>Check for non-local root accounts</li>
		<li>Check for anonymous users</li>
		<li>Check for wildcard host accounts</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Passwords
	<ul>
		<li>Look for accounts with empty passwords (implies no password
		required)</li>
		<li>Look for different users sharing the same password</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Privileges
	<ul>
		<li>Report non-root accounts with all grants</li>
		<li>Report non-root accounts with administrative privileges (e.g.
		SUPER, SHUTDOWN)</li>
		<li>Report non-root accounts with powerful modification
		privileges (e.g. DROP, ALTER)</li>
		<li>Report non-root accounts with data manipulation privileges on
		all schemata</li>
		<li>Report non-root accounts with write access to the `mysql`
		schema</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>General
	<ul>
		<li>Check the security related sql_mode</li>
		<li>See if old passwords are used</li>
		<li>See if networking is enabled</li>
		<li>See if the `test` schema exists</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
If --assume-root is used, then in addition to user 'root', all listed
users are handled in the same way as 'root'. This means some tests will
be more restrictive on those users, and some more permissive.
