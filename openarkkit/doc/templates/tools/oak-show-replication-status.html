<h3>NAME</h3>
oak-show-replication-status: show how far behind are replicating slaves on a given master
<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
Show the replication status on the localhost machine:
<blockquote>oak-show-replication-status</blockquote>
Show the replication status on a given master database:
<blockquote>oak-show-replication-status --host=192.168.2.103</blockquote>
Show the replication status on a given master database, expect two slaves:
<blockquote>oak-show-replication-status --host=192.168.2.103 --expect-num-slaves=2</blockquote>
Show the replication status on a given master database, expect two slaves, consider 20 seconds lag to be normal delay:
<blockquote>oak-show-replication-status --host=192.168.2.103 -n 2 --normal-delay=20</blockquote>
Same as above, provide connection parameters, prompt for password:
<blockquote>oak-show-replication-status --host=192.168.2.103  --user=root --ask-pass --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock -n 2 -d 20</blockquote>
Same as above, use defaults file:
<blockquote>oak-show-replication-status --defaults-file=/home/myuser/.my-oak.cnf -n 2 -d 20</blockquote>
<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
oak-show-replication-status outputs a short report which diagnoses how far behind a given master are its slaves.

The utility connects to a master server, reads the master status, locates the active slaves, connects to those slaves, and reads their slave status. The utility considers a "normal delay behind the master" and reports the following:
<ul>
	<li>The current master logs file</li>
	<li>If any slaves are missing (see --expect-num-slaves), an error message</li>
	<li>For each connected slave: its master log file, seconds behind master and status.</li>
</ul>
The "status" part will hsow one of the following:
<ul>
	<li>"Good": the slave is up to date with the master: it is less than "--normal-delay" behind master.</li>
	<li>"Lag": the slave is more than "--normal-delay" behind master, but is up to date with latest binary log.</li>
	<li>"Far behind": the slave is more than "--normal-delay" behind master, and is not even up to date with latest binary log.</li>
</ul>
This is a sample report output:
<blockquote>
<pre>-- master log: mymaster-bin.001761
-- Slave host   Master_Log_File       Seconds_Behind_Master   Status
-- myslave1     mymaster-bin.001761   0                       Good
-- myslave2     mymaster-bin.001761   0                       Good</pre>
</blockquote>
The binary log considered is the last one fetched by the slave (and is not necessarily processed yet).

oak-show-replication-status does not act recursively. If one of the slaves is itself a master, the utility does not check up on its slaves.
<h3>OPTIONS</h3>
--ask-pass
<p class="indent">Prompt for password.</p>

-d NORMAL_DELAY, --normal-delay=NORMAL_DELAY
<p class="indent">Acceptable seconds behind master. A slave lagging behind less than give number is considered to be in "Good" state.</p>

--defaults-file=DEFAULTS_FILE
<p class="indent">Read from MySQL configuration file. Overrides --user, --password, --socket, --port.</p>
<p class="indent">Configuration needs to be in the following format:</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>[client]<br/>
user=my_user<br/>
password=my_pass<br/>
socket=/tmp/mysql.sock<br/>
port=3306</strong>
</p>

-H HOST, --host=HOST
<p class="indent">MySQL master host (default: localhost)</p>

-n EXPECT_NUM_SLAVES, --expect-num-slaves=EXPECT_NUM_SLAVES
<p class="indent">Number of slaves to expect (default: 0). If less than given number slaves can be found, and error message is written.</p>

-p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
<p class="indent">MySQL password. The same password is expected to apply for the master and the slaves.</p>

-P PORT, --port=PORT
<p class="indent">TCP/IP port (default: 3306)</p>

--skip-show-slave-hosts
<p class="indent">When SHOW SLAVE HOSTS returns rows, these are considered the only slave hosts. Otherwise slaves are found looking at SHOW PROCESSLIST. With --skip-show-slave-hosts, only SHOW PROCESSLIST is used.</p>

-S SOCKET, --socket=SOCKET
<p class="indent">MySQL socket file. Only applies when host is localhost</p>

-u USER, --user=USER
<p class="indent">MySQL user. The same user is expected to apply for the master and the slaves.</p>
