<h3>NAME</h3>
oak-chunk-update: Perform long, non-blocking UPDATE/DELETE operation in auto managed small chunks
<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
Delete rows from world.City where population is small:
<blockquote>oak-chunk-update --database=world --execute="DELETE FROM City WHERE Population &lt; 10000000 AND OAK_CHUNK(City)"</blockquote>
Same as above, provide fully qualified table names, use <b>100</b> rows chunk size:
<blockquote>oak-chunk-update --execute="DELETE FROM world.City WHERE Population &lt; 10000000 AND OAK_CHUNK(world.City)" --chunk-size=100</blockquote>
Same as above, sleep for <b>200</b> milliseconds between chunks, verbose:
<blockquote>oak-chunk-update --database=world --execute="DELETE FROM City WHERE Population &lt; 10000000 AND OAK_CHUNK(City)" --chunk-size=100 --sleep=200 --verbose</blockquote>
Same as above, quit when no rows are affected: 
<blockquote>oak-chunk-update --database=world --execute="DELETE FROM City WHERE Population &lt; 10000000 AND OAK_CHUNK(City)" --chunk-size=100 --sleep=200 --verbose --terminate-on-not-found</blockquote>
Perform a multi-table UPDATE operation, choose world.City as chunking table:
<blockquote>oak-chunk-update --execute="UPDATE City, Country SET City.District = 'unknown' WHERE City.CountryCode = Country.Code AND Country.Continent = 'Africa' AND OAK_CHUNK(City)"</blockquote>
Same as above, avoid using INFORMATION_SCHEMA by specifying chunk key:
<blockquote>oak-chunk-update --execute="UPDATE City, Country SET City.District = 'unknown' WHERE City.CountryCode = Country.Code AND Country.Continent = 'Africa' AND OAK_CHUNK(City)" --force-chunking-column=id:integer</blockquote>
Same as above, specify constant start position and end position:
<blockquote>oak-chunk-update --execute="UPDATE City, Country SET City.District = 'unknown' WHERE City.CountryCode = Country.Code AND Country.Continent = 'Africa' AND OAK_CHUNK(City)" --force-chunking-column=id:integer --start-with=1074 --end-with=2990</blockquote>
Same as above, specify query start position, skip locks:
<blockquote>oak-chunk-update --execute="UPDATE City, Country SET City.District = 'unknown' WHERE City.CountryCode = Country.Code AND Country.Continent = 'Africa' AND OAK_CHUNK(City)" --force-chunking-column=id:integer --start-with="SELECT MIN(id) FROM world.City WHERE District=''" --skip-lock-tables</blockquote>
Provide connection parameters. Prompt for password:
<blockquote>oak-chunk-update --user=root --ask-pass --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock  --database=world --execute="DELETE FROM City WHERE Population &lt; 10000000 AND OAK_CHUNK(City)"</blockquote>
Use a defaults file for parameters.
<blockquote>oak-chunk-update --defaults-file=/home/myuser/.my-oak.cnf  --database=world --execute="DELETE FROM City WHERE Population &lt; 10000000 AND OAK_CHUNK(City)"</blockquote>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>
This utility allows for splitting long running or non-indexed UPDATE/DELETE oprations, optionally multi-table ones.
Long running updating queries are often used. Some examples:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Purging old table records (e.g. purging old logs).</li>
	<li>Updating a column on a table scale.</li>
	<li>Deleting or updating a small number of rows, but with a non-indexed search condition.</li>
	<li>Inserting into one table aggregated values from other tables.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>oak-chunk-update</i> splits such long running tasks into small chunks. It also allows for sleep time between chunks. This allows for less lock time, better replication responsiveness (less lag) and less stress on system resources (CPU, IO).
To perform, the utility uses a UNIQUE KEY on a given table, which is used for the splitting process.
Note that the query may involve multiple tables (JOINed), in which case one of the tables must have a UNIQUE KEY.
The utility requires, then:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>At least on of the tables participating in the UPDATE/DELETE query has a UNIQUE KEY.</li>
	<li>The query must indicate to the utility the table for which the UNIQUE KEY is used.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The query must include a hint in the form <strong>OAK_CHUNK(table_name)</strong> or <strong>OAK_CHUNK(database_name.table_name)</strong>. See SYNOPSIS for examples.
The table indicated in the <strong>OAK_CHUNK</strong> clause is the table which must contain a UNIQUE KEY, which is used for splitting the query. The utility rewrites the query by iteratively replacing the <strong>OAK_CHUNK(...)</strong> clause with appropriate values from the UNIQUE KEY.
In case more than one UNIQUE KEY is available on the table, the utility chooses in the following order:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>If there's a PRIMARY KEY - this is the selected key</li>
	<li>A key for which the first column is non-textual is prefereable to a key for which the first column is textual</li>
	<li>A key with a smaller numeric data type takes precedance</li>
	<li>A key with fewer columns take precedance</li>
</ul>
<p>
The tool auto selects the chunking key by observing <b>INFORMATION_SCHEMA</b>. Reading from <b>INFORMATION_SCHEMA</b> is risky on large, busy servers.
It is possible to instruct the tool to use a specific column, by adding <b>--force-chunking-column</b>. 
</p>
<p>
Limiting the number of scanned rows is done via <b>--start-with</b> and <b>--end-with</b>. Neither, either or both can be specified, as constant or 
as a SELECT query returning a single integer value. In the latter case it is required that the chunking key is itself an integer. 
<b>--terminate-on-not-found</b> is another way of limiting scanned rows, by instructing the tool to quit the first time the query has no effect. 
This works well for monotonic columns, e.g. TIMESTAMP columns with increasing values. 
</p>

<h3>OPTIONS</h3>
--ask-pass
<p class="indent">Prompt for password.</p>

-c CHUNK_SIZE, --chunk-size=CHUNK_SIZE
<p class="indent">Number of rows to act on in chunks (default: 1000). 0 means all rows updated in one operation
The lower the number, the shorter any locks are held, but the more operations required and the more total running time.

-d DATABASE, --database=DATABASE
<p class="indent">Database name (required unless table is fully qualified)</p>

--defaults-file=DEFAULTS_FILE
<p class="indent">Read from MySQL configuration file. Overrides --user, --password, --socket, --port.</p>
<p class="indent">Configuration needs to be in the following format:</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>[client]<br/>
user=my_user<br/>
password=my_pass<br/>
socket=/tmp/mysql.sock<br/>
port=3306</strong>
</p>

--end-with=END_WITH   
<p class="indent">Assuming chunking on numeric field (e.g.
AUTO_INCREMENT), end chunking with this value. Either
provide a constant or a query returning a single
integer value.</p>

-e EXECUTE_QUERY, --execute=EXECUTE_QUERY
<p class="indent">Query to execute, which contains a chunk placeholder
in the form of OAK_CHUNK(table_name) (required)</p>

--force-chunking-column=FORCED_CHUNKING_COLUMN
<p class="indent">
Columns to chunk by; avoids querying in
INFORMATION_SCHEMA. Format: either column_name:type,
where type is integer/text/temporal - for single
column keys, or column1_name,column2_name,... for one
or more column keys, with no type.
</p>

-H HOST, --host=HOST
<p class="indent">MySQL host (default: localhost)</p>

--no-log-bin
<p class="indent">Do not log to binary log (actions will not replicate). This may be useful if the slave already finds it hard to replicate behind master. The utility may be spawned manually on slave machines, therefore utilizing more than one CPU core on those machines, making replication process faster due to parallelism.</p>

-p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
<p class="indent">MySQL password</p>

-P PORT, --port=PORT
<p class="indent">TCP/IP port (default: 3306)</p>

--print-progress
<p class="indent">Show number of affected rows during utility runtime</p>

--sleep=SLEEP_MILLIS
<p class="indent">Number of milliseconds to sleep between chunks. Default: 0</p>

--skip-lock-tables    
<p class="indent">Do not issue a LOCK TABLES READ. May be required when
using queries within --start-with or --end-with
</p>

--skip-retry-chunk    
<p class="indent">Avoid retrying a chunk operation on error. Default: false
</p>

-S SOCKET, --socket=SOCKET
<p class="indent">MySQL socket file. Only applies when host is localhost</p>

--start-with=START_WITH
<p class="indent">Assuming chunking on numeric field (e.g.
AUTO_INCREMENT), start chunking from this value and
onward. Either provide a constant or a query returning
a single integer value.
</p>

--terminate-on-not-found
<p class="indent">Terminate on first occurrence where chunking did not
affect any rows (default: False)
</p>

-u USER, --user=USER
<p class="indent">MySQL user</p>

-v, --verbose
<p class="indent">Print user friendly messages</p>
